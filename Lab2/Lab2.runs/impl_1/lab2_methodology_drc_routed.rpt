Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin datapath/Audio_Codec/audio_inout/Cnt_Lrclk_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin datapath/Audio_Codec/audio_inout/Cnt_Lrclk_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#9 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin datapath/Audio_Codec/audio_inout/Cnt_Lrclk_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#10 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin datapath/Audio_Codec/audio_inout/Cnt_Lrclk_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#11 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin datapath/Audio_Codec/audio_inout/Cnt_Lrclk_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#12 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin datapath/Audio_Codec/audio_inout/LRCLK_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock datapath/Audio_Codec/audiocodec_master_clock/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin datapath/Audio_Codec/audiocodec_master_clock/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock datapath/video_inst/mmcm_adv_inst_display_clocks/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin datapath/video_inst/mmcm_adv_inst_display_clocks/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O, datapath/clk
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-2#1 Warning
Scoped Non-Timing constraint/property overwritten  
A new XDC property IOSTANDARD on reset_n overrides a previous scoped property. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) property and could result in unexpected behaviours.
