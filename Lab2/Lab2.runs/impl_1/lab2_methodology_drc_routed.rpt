TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock datapath/Audio_Codec/audiocodec_master_clock/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin datapath/Audio_Codec/audiocodec_master_clock/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock datapath/video_inst/mmcm_adv_inst_display_clocks/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin datapath/video_inst/mmcm_adv_inst_display_clocks/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-2#1 Warning
Scoped Non-Timing constraint/property overwritten  
A new XDC property IOSTANDARD on reset_n overrides a previous scoped property. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) property and could result in unexpected behaviours.
